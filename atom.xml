    <title>GST - Taxing even a free Lunch?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/gst2.jpg" alt=""><br>They say, there is nothing called a free lunch. For argument’s sake, let’s suppose there is. Can that be taxed too?</p>
<p>Mr. Legal Eagle is among the top Chartered Accountants of the country, he represents only the who’s - who of the business world. Success is his second name and his charges are in millions. In a rare deviation, he argued a case for <em>Philanthropy Philia</em>, an NGO catering to orphan children. Given the noble cause, he did it free of cost, (needless to say!) won the case and lunched with the trustee of the NGO.</p>
<p>The trustee, a renowned business tycoon, engaged him for an identical case concerning his business. Our friend charged the usual lakhs, no charity there. And of course discharged the taxes on those millions. However, to his utter astonishment, he receives a notice from the tax dept, accusing him of evading taxes on the services to the NGO!</p>
<p>Sounds rather fanciful or fictional? Once upon a happy time, one could have been forgiven for assuming so. That could very well be the reality staring under GST, unless clarified. </p>
<p>As always, the devil is in the detail. <em>Schedule 1</em> to the GST Law, envisions circumstances which are to be treated as a <strong><em>supply without consideration</em></strong>. <em>Clause 5</em> of this Schedule is reproduced below: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Supply of goods and / or services by a taxable person to another taxable or non-taxable person in the course or furtherance of business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>“….In the course or furtherance of business.”</em>  Who exactly determines that, is it the business owner or the taxman? Ideally, it has to be the businessman. Who else but the businessman knows his business or his intentions? The taxman cannot and should not step into the shoes of the businessman and sit in judgment. But in an environment where fencing and revenue safeguards form the foundations of the law, the last word is always with the taxman. And the taxman faithfully believes in 2 of <em>Murphy’s laws</em>: <em>“If something can go wrong, it will”</em>. Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. </p>
<p>In the analogy above, the taxman will undoubtedly argue that the intention of Mr. Legal Eagle was furtherance of business. The pro bono representation was no free lunch: it was meant to secure business opportunities, and it did! Can such oblique nexus be sufficient to conclude business intentions? Should the law leave it to the discretion of the individual taxman? If yes, shouldn’t there at least be safeguards to prevent flimsy and clumsy inferences? </p>
<p>Still not convinced? Alright, I’ll speak like Mr Legal Eagle. Let’s look at Section 123!</p>
<blockquote><p>“If any person claims that he is not liable to pay tax under the Act in respect of any supply of goods and/or services, or that he is eligible for input tax credit under section 16, the burden of proving such claim or claims shall lie on him.” - Section 123</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, there’s really no such thing called a free lunch. Assuming that the taxman still insists on taxing Mr Legal Eagle’s philanthropy, how will he value it? Lets’ save that for the next post, I’m hungry. (P.S I’m buying my lunch!)</p>
<p>Alternative interpretations or views are of course possible, one is welcome to voice them. Please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below!</p>

    <title>Is GST a Fix-It-ALL?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/gst.jpg" alt=""><br>Lots of articles have been written, hosannas sung and paeans composed… perhaps rightly so. Nothing to take away from the fact that it’s a game changer, redefining taxation in India. But in its present form, is it the panacea or a fix-it- all for your tax woes? This article, looks at the collateral the roll out of GST will entail.<br><blockquote><p>The GST is undoubtedly the biggest reform in a quarter of a century</p>
<footer><strong>Anonymous!!</strong></footer></blockquote></p>
<h3 id="Your-compliance-burden"><a href="#Your-compliance-burden" class="headerlink" title="Your compliance burden"></a><strong>Your compliance burden</strong></h3><p>Let’s assume you provide some taxable services in 10 Indian states. You will be required to take registrations in all these 10 states, and file 37 returns for each state. Which means you are looking at <strong>370 returns annually!</strong> In contrast, you were filing 2 returns a year till yesterday. Not exactly easy, is it?</p>
<h3 id="Dual-Control"><a href="#Dual-Control" class="headerlink" title="Dual Control"></a><strong>Dual Control</strong></h3><p>Each transaction will now be taxed by both the centre and the states. Which means, you have to answer the Centre, as well as the state in which you provided the service or sell goods to. That the taxman is a creature hard to please is hardly a secret. More chances of running into him!</p>
<h3 id="Unified-Tax-Regime"><a href="#Unified-Tax-Regime" class="headerlink" title="Unified Tax Regime"></a><strong>Unified Tax Regime</strong></h3><p>Largely true, but too simplistic to be truly true! Customs Duty (BCD) will continue to be charged the way it currently is. Taxes levied at the Local Authority level like entertainment tax, profession tax in some states etc will see no change. Products like tobacco will have a separate excise duty levied by the Centre. States will continue to tax alcohol. When exactly will petroleum be brought within the GST ambit is uncertain. One nation, one tax? Phew, they said One Rank, One Pension (<strong>OROP</strong>) wasn’t easy. :-)</p>
<h3 id="Self-Supply"><a href="#Self-Supply" class="headerlink" title="Self-Supply"></a><strong>Self-Supply</strong></h3><p>Let’s say you are a large consulting firm with branches in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. </p>
<p><strong>Senario 1</strong> : The Bangalore branch specializes in a particular competency, and hence provides assistance to the other branches when needed. What’s the big deal, you helped yourself. Well? Welcome to the new era, you are required to pay tax on these services you provided to your own self. And how do you value them? Let’s save it for another day!!</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong> :<br>Let’s say you transferred some goods to your agent for sale. Actual sale is only when the agent sells, isn’t it? The GST law requires you to pay for this transfer too, supply to your own agent is itself a taxable event! Credit can be taken, but what about the opportunity cost of capital blocked?</p>
<h3 id="Another-Transfer-Pricing-Regime"><a href="#Another-Transfer-Pricing-Regime" class="headerlink" title="Another Transfer Pricing Regime?"></a><strong>Another Transfer Pricing Regime?</strong></h3><p>Hitherto, there was no law governing the valuation of services between related parties such as sister concerns, group companies etc. Stray cases were picked up in adjudication (and undoubtedly ended in litigation!), but there was no explicit law. GST introduces this concept for the first time, where it expects such supplies to be valued on the basis of parameters such as “like supplies”, “like quantity” etc. In other words, you are required to demonstrate Arm’s Length in these transactions. We may a witness a Transfer Pricing regime in GST too, with high pitched adjustments and disputes.</p>
<h3 id="Input-Credits"><a href="#Input-Credits" class="headerlink" title="Input Credits"></a><strong>Input Credits</strong></h3><p>The moment you paid your supplier for his wares, you were eligible for Input Credit. Nay, you didn’t even have to actually pay to take credit, an invoice was enough! Under the GST regime, you pay the vendor, wait for him to deposit the tax, wait for him to report it, and again wait for it to reflect in your account electronically. Exporters will also have to wait before they recoup their reversals. This will undoubtedly hamper working capital big time, make no mistake! Hopefully a robust IT infrastructure alleviates the pain to a certain extent.</p>
<h3 id="Business-Model"><a href="#Business-Model" class="headerlink" title="Business Model"></a><strong>Business Model</strong></h3><p>With movement from a source based taxation to a destination based one, business and operation models may need to be re-worked. Especially multi-brand sellers, e-commerce platforms and aggregators operating market place models. How exactly they warehouse their goods is a significant strategy that may call for recalibration.</p>
<h3 id="One-National-GST"><a href="#One-National-GST" class="headerlink" title="One National GST?"></a><strong>One National GST?</strong></h3><p>Alas, it is not to be. It’s a multi-layered GST. Transactions within the state attract both the <strong>CGST</strong> (Central GST) and the <strong>SGST</strong> (State GST), while those between two-states attract the IGST (Inter Stated GST). And there is no free utilization of these credits at will, there is a restriction and hierarchy governing the utilization.</p>
<h3 id="E-commerce-operators-aggregators-and-Online-Service-Providers"><a href="#E-commerce-operators-aggregators-and-Online-Service-Providers" class="headerlink" title="E-commerce operators, aggregators and Online Service Providers"></a><strong>E-commerce operators, aggregators and Online Service Providers</strong></h3><p>The definition and scope of the above are like a tricky staircase, which could lead you somewhere different on a Thursday. E-Commerce operators at times partially function as aggregators, but the two classes are defined differently with different liabilities. Function based classification is ambiguous, there are a lot of common functions both perform. Who is in and who is out of which category is anybody’s guess based on the definition. Further aggregators could be treated as service providers for the full value of the transaction (in truth, only their commission concerns them). In addition, the e-commerce operators are subject to a TCS regime (more on it later).</p>
<p><strong>In sum</strong>, one might be led to believe that the article is fraught with pessimism. On the contrary, the author believes that the GST is a much needed law, where the positives outnumber the shortcomings. This said, it is as well to be aware of what one is walking into, he who is forewarned is twice armed. The GST is a law still in the making, and the author hopes that difficulties, when voiced will be addressed. Wishing a truly perfect GST, which not only addresses the need of the states, but also is business-friendly.</p>

    <title>In light of the surfeit of &#39;logic&#39; floating around</title>
    <link href="http://justangle.com/2016/07/26/convenient-isnt-it/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/convenient_perception1.jpg" alt=""><br>The omnipotent and infinite lord, is formless. He does not have any form………… Isn’t there an inherent contradiction in that?</p>
<p>The Lord is omnipotent generally, but is impotent to assume a form? And the Lord, whose limits we fix in finite terms, is infinite?</p>
<p>The moment we limit the possibilities of what the Lord can or cannot, we reduce the Lord to finite and definite. Conversely, how can one fathom infinity to go so far as to constrain it?</p>
<p>Either emphatic assertion, that he is only with form or the one that precludes form are both logically limiting. As Sri Ramakrishna used to say, when in the gaseous state, H2O has no form; in the liquid state, it is free flowing and in the solid state, it simply takes the shape of the container.</p>
<p>Let’s make an allowance for both, but what is the point worshipping a stone or wooden image? Does idol worship ever make sense? Well, the idol itself is never the target or object of worship.</p>
<p>In course of his travels, Swami Vivekananda reached Alwar and was accosted by the king Mangal Singh. The Maharaja asked him, “I find the image-worship you people engage in meaningless. Why would anyone want to worship clay, metal or stone?” Swami Vivekananda looked around and saw a painting of the king’s father hanging on the wall, and requested that it be brought down to him. He then asked the king to spit on it. The king was infuriated and burst out “How can I spit on my father? What guts should you have to seek it!” Swami Vivekananda exclaimed, “But where is your father here? Isn’t it paint and paper?” The king was tongue tied, it was his own logic after all. Swami Vivekananda then went on to explain that the idol is simply meant to remind the worshipper of the principle it symbolized or represented. All worship offered, was to the Being it reminded of and not itself.</p>
<p>But why leave room for form and formless, and on top of it multiple forms? A “one-size-fits-all” approach wouldn’t really benefit everybody. If the only shop in town that sold clothes, had only one size? And only one pattern and colour? Would it suit everybody? The contemplation, comprehension and assimilation levels vary between people, just as physiques do. He chooses that form that is conducive to his state.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it mean there are many Gods that get worshipped? There are cookies shaped as a key, a bird, a house etc. Children fight over them, with one choosing a house and another a key. Does it mean that each child is eating many different biscuits? Forms vary, but the fundamental substance remains the same. To the child, a particular form beckons. So also, to the worshipper. All rivers finally culminate in the ocean.</p>

    <title>Rajya Sabha Impasse, Is Money Bill the Answer?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/RSabha_nostalgic.jpg" alt=""><br>“<strong>Fools rush in, where angels fear to tread</strong>”, it is said. A draconian law like <strong>Section 66A</strong> of the IT Act, was passed by the Rajya Sabha (not just the Lok Sabha) without so much as a sneeze, cough or murmur. Contrast this with the Rajya Sabha’s united ambush against something totally perfunctory and inconsequential, as an amendment to the motion of thanks to the President’s address! The effect? A few words added and the paper dumped into some bin. But going by their seriousness, one would have thought the nation’s very existence hung on it. Other than embarrassing the government, it would serve no other purpose. Indeed it seemed that some members had no other purpose. When essential businesses are held ransom to such petty behavior by a few (who seem to have infinite time for leisure and mischief), what is the way out?</p>
<p>Currently important legislations sail through the Lok Sabha and then may go into what could possibly be a dead end or black hole (select committee of the Rajya Sabha). Essential reforms introduced by representatives directly elected by the people, are blocked by a house that provides for (with due respect) back door entry. In a bicameral legislature like India, the general rule is that a bill becomes law once both the houses of the parliament pass it. But impasse sets in when one proposes, and the other disposes. Can the nation afford this absurd game?</p>
<p>Certainly not. And the central govt. seems to agree, as it explores the “money bill” route to circumvent these mindless opposition. While there is no definitive solution to this cat and mouse game, the constitution thankfully exempts “money bills” from this acrimonious farce. The money bill route definitely gives some respite, albeit limited, as it has the following peculiarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (unlike the other bills). The Lok Sabha Speaker’s stamp, certifying a bill as a “money bill” is final, and not open to anybody’s question, even the courts cannot interfere.</li>
<li>The Rajya Sabha has to vote on the money bill passed by the Lok Sabha and return within 14 days. The recommendations of the Rajya Sabha are not binding, and the Lok Sabha may choose to pass the bill in its original form.</li>
<li>If the Rajya Sabha fails to vote on it within 14 days, the bill is deemed to be passed!</li>
<li>It cannot be referred to a Joint Committee of the houses, thereby precluding intentional stalling.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this might seem a wonderful panacea, it may be noted that not all businesses can be transacted as a money bill. What then is a money bill? Article 110 of the Constitution describes the purposes, to address which a money bill is resorted to. A money bill is one that seeks to (any of the following):</p>
<ul>
<li>Levy any tax or abolish, modify the same (any tax like income tax, customs duty etc)</li>
<li>Administer the flows of Consolidated Fund of India, and the expenditures from it (Consolidated Fund is the ocean into which all the govt.’s loans, the taxes collected from you etc. flow).</li>
<li>Regulate any borrowing by the Central Govt., or any financial obligation to be incurred by it.</li>
<li>Public money and it’s audit in case of accounts of State / Central govt</li>
<li>Issues incidental to the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term incidental is rather deceptive! It can be wide enough to go beyond the usual routine such as tax rates and the subject matter of taxation, and touch upon machinery, mechanisms &amp; methods as well. At the same time, a bill does not become a money bill merely for the reason it encompasses fees and fines. Hunt with the hounds and run with the hares, eh?</p>
<p>As can be seen, only issues which fall in the above realm can be passed as a money bill. The black money bill was one such example, where the bill sailed through the Rajya Sabha. The antagonists were left gnashing their teeth, as they wanted to stall it by referring to the Standing Committee (aka the black hole committee).</p>
<p>Goods and Service Tax (GST), which seeks to bring about a unified tax regime is a much sought after reform, and the govt. is pushing it really hard. What prevents the GST bill from being passed as a money bill? Unfortunately it needs an amendment of the constitution, and constitutional amendment bills cannot be classified as money bills, even if it addresses the above issues. So, such barriers will continue till such time our leaders rise above petty considerations, and worry about the nation.</p>
<p>Some possible solutions that could possibly solve the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abolition of whips (Whips are orders issued by a political party that binds all members to stick to a particular stand, failing which they risk expulsion). Conscientious voting by members could perhaps see different results.</li>
<li>Trifurcation of representation in the Rajya Sabha among States, group of professionals &amp; domain experts and the ruling group. This way, a majority can be forged where the proposition is reasonable.</li>
<li>Representation of the states be made truly representative of the people’s will of the day. This can be ensured by making representation co-terminus and ex-officio with the tenure of the state legislative assemblies. Currently, the newly elected assemblies get their representation years after they get elected.</li>
<li>Legislating a fixed period for select committees to give their recommendations, ensuring they don’t become black holes.</li>
<li>Some of the seats can be directly elected by the people, and qualifications prescribed for contestants (such as high specializations in fields of finance, medicine, technology etc).</li>
</ul>
