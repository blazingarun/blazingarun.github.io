It is said that every story has three versions: My version, his version and the truth. In a world steeped in relativity, positions too are relative. But the quest is for the absolute! Thus it may be said that every view is "just an angle", in quest of the "just angle" :)

An imaginative mind with its myriad perceptions, projects many dimensions. This space is simply a platform that articulates this. The many-sidedness of each equation, be it politics or sports, theology or mythology. To distinguish, not extinguish!
